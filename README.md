# SNAP

Snap is a Phantom Forces Script with features like Aimbot, Silent Aim, ESP, FOV and more! It is my best Phantom Forces Script yet. Ever Since Phantom Forces stopped accepting obfuscated scripts such as Evo V2, there has been a need for a new script that will work. This one is guarunteed to work every time. If it doesn't just report it as a bug on our [discord server](https://dsc.gg/PDennSploit/).

# Usage

To Use SNAP copy the code below and paste it into your exploit. Then attach your exploit and then inject! Simple as that!
